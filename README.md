This is the starter code for the WordStack workshop. 
This workshop is part of the Applied CS with Android course:

The goal of this project was to implement the drag and drop functionality, create the logic that displays the order that the letters are displayed, and make the undo button work. The primary data structures used by this activity was stacks and queues. I also incorporated a label that lets the user know when they have guessed the word correctly.

Wordstack is a game that combines any random two words from a dictionary. The words all get shuffled into a stack. The user has to guess the two words by dragging the cards into the two boxes. If the user reaches the end of the stack the two correct words are displayed.
